Submission for Team Abhiyaan
==============================

Name: 
Romil Chouhan

Roll Number:
EE20B112

PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
--------------------
    Basic knowledge about Python Programming Language, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and sklearn
    Know core cocepts about Machine Learning. Handy with Tensorflow2
    A few things about Deep learning. Using Pytorch
    Participated in some ML competitions and worked out few Ml project (from kaggle)
    A few ML topics, and model familiar with: Regression, Classification, Support Vector Machines, Ensemble Learning (Bagging and    Boosting  algorithm),Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, MultiLayer Perceptrons, Networks, GANs and Reinforcement Learning (little bit)


Current PORs:
-------------
    None just done volunteering for Shaastra Coding and Logic

Why I want to work in the team:
-------------------------------
	Because I am always fascinated with Artificial Intelligence and its applications. Had been so enthusiastic for ML and DL. I had been learning some concepts of ML, Dl, joining several webinars, some small competitions, hackathons. I think this team will give me an amazing opportunity so continue my journey of learning these concepts. Abhiyaan is closely related to artificial intelligence and its topic of working is really good and this I believe will be a great opportunity for me to actually test my knowledge over some real things, working along with expert guidance which definitely will improve my learning curve.
